~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another messy conglomeration of code.
This time we're training a connect 4 engine, which should be more
fun to play against hopefully. Also a better guage of the effectiveness
of the method for training the engine.
This time, I at least deleted most of the code that wasn't being used.

This is original comment from Michael Nielsen's original code:
A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using backpropagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code
simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.

MCTS.py

Below is the comment from the original code which I, Brendan Milway, have modified for my purposes:
This is a very simple implementation of the UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm in Python 2.7.
The function UCT(rootstate, itermax, verbose = False) is towards the bottom of the code.
It aims to have the clearest and simplest possible code, and for the sake of clarity, the code
is orders of magnitude less efficient than it could be made, particularly by using a 
state.GetRandomMove() or state.DoRandomRollout() function.
Example GameState classes for Nim, OXO and Othello are included to give some idea of how you
can write your own GameState use UCT in your 2-player game. Change the game to be played in 
the UCTPlayGame() function at the bottom of the code.

MUCT_training.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is where we train the engine. We start by initializing the neural network 
with random weights. After each practice session we update the network based on 
the results of the modified-UCT player vs itself. As the network improves, the 
modified-UCT player improves, and the results from his games against himself give 
better training data. This in turn improves the performance of the neural network.
The resulting feedback loop rapidly improves the skill of the eninge until,
eventually, it reaches an expert level.
